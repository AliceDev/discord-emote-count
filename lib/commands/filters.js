**Available filters**
    \`server:id\` --> \`id\` is the id of a server
    \`server:here\` --> uses the current server's id if the command is used in a server
    \`user:id\` --> \`id\` is the id of a user (you can also directly mention a user)
    \`user:me\` --> uses your id
    \`emote:id\` --> \`id\` is the id of a custom emote
    You can also directly use any emote, custom or not, to filter by it
        Example: \`ğŸ¤” :emote:\` (assuming you have access to an emote named 'emote')
    \`duplicate:no\` --> doesn't count duplicate emotes in messages
    \`order:ascending\` --> put the least used emotes on top instead of bottom
    \`limit:n\` --> displays **n** results (defaults to ${defaultEntriesLimit})
    \`since:id\` --> keeps entries from messages sent since the message with id \`id\`

Using multiple filters of the same category will keep any of the given values.
This currently only applies to the server, user, and emote filters.
    Example: \`user:me @Someone#1234\` --> entries for me or Someone#1234
    Example: \`ğŸ¤” ğŸ‘Œ\` --> entries for ğŸ¤” or ğŸ‘Œ
    Example: \`server:here user:me ğŸ¤” ğŸ‘Œ\` --> my entries for ğŸ¤” or ğŸ‘Œ in the server`);
